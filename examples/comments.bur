; This line is commented out
This should be the first thing you see in this document; there's another line above it in the source file, but it's commented out, so it shouldn't make it into the output. There are more below that we shouldn't see as well.
; There also shouldn't be anything below this line
; Aren't comments fun?
; For example, you can have lots of comments explaining your typographic approach,
; general reflections on your writing process, or passages you remove while revising.
; The world is your oyster!
