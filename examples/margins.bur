This line should be much deeper into the page and much narrower than the default lines, because we've changed our margins to 3 inches instead of the default 1 inch. Notice how this only leaves us with 2.5 inches in the middle column! Therefore, our measure is far too low.

.margins[1in]
At this point, we should be back to our normal margin of 1 inch all the way around. Note how this change happens mid-page. This is part of how we'll allow typographers to have control over where the text goes on the page.

Now, we should be back to the narrow margins from before. We did this via -, the reset command, which puts whatever command we used back to its previous value (before the last change).
