This is a demonstration of .italic[Burro], a new typesetting language 
designed for text-heavy documents.

Burro is designed to be easy to type while retaining complete control 
over the output. It aims to be a middle ground between the~limited power 
of Markdown and the heaviness of TeX and friends. Burro is directly inspired by,
and hopes to be a spiritual successor to, groff with the mom macro set. 

Burro does not try to guess where things should go on the~page; 
rather, as a typographer, .bold[you] choose your layout settings 
and Burro applies those to the text. 
Burro aims to feel more like setting type in a printing press 
than just typing into a document.
